Current:
The MIMO simulation works well.
The UART-configuration-communication works well.
The ethernet-data-communication cannot work.

Added a by-pass register-read/write logic inside the esn_core.
Only use the esn_core_tb as the testbench
The simulation waveform looks good but still not work on FPGA.

TODO:
Use the demo_tb.v to test the esn_core_with_FIFO
Add flag bits or LCD display to debug the FPGA communcation procedure.
